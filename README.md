# Document Scanner Using OpenCV Python
A simple Document Scanner, similar to the popular CamScanner, implemented using OpenCV Python.

## Methods used 
- Canny Edge Detection
- Perspective Transforms 
- Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding
- Contour Detection


## Future Extensions to Project
Hope to implement an Object Character Recogniotion(OCR) on the scanned image to extract text.
